            <p>The movie series Pirates of the Carribean is an action-adventure story in a time where pirates still roamed the world, looking for plunder and treasure. The main character is Jack Sparrow, a rogue and unusually heroic pirate. There are 5 movies available, and while all of them get me excited, none quite compare to the very first.

                <h2>What is the Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl about?
                </h2> 

                    <p>The movie begins with a ship coming across a shipwreck with a lone survivor, a boy named Will Turner. On board the ship are governor Swann, the new governor of Port Royal, Jamaica, and his young daughter Elizabeth. The young boy is hauled aboard, and Elizabeth discovers a golden skull medallion around Will's neck. Fearing that he will be executed as a pirate, she quickly hides it from the others. Elizabeth briefly glimpses another ship with shredded black sails vanishing into the mist,
                    </p> 
                    <p>Eight years later, Captain Norrington is being promoted to Commodore. Elizabeth attends the ceremony at her fathers request. Norrington is Elizabeth's suitor. As he begins to propose to her on the battlements, she faints because of the tight bodice she was wearing, tumbling over the wall into the bay. Destitute pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, only just arrived in Port Royal, rescues Elizabeth from drowning. The skull medallion Elizabeth is wearing around her neck, emits a mysterious pulse through the water as she is sinking.  After saving Elizabeth, the occupying British forces attempt to arrest Jack for piracy, for which he has been branded on the forearm by the East India Trading Company.  Sparrow escapes and ducks into a blacksmith shop where he encounters Will Turner — now a blacksmith's apprentice. Will is also a seeker of Elizabeth, but due to his social rank, hides his feelings for her. Following a swordfight with Turner, Sparrow is knocked unconscious by Will's employer (who slept through the entire fight) and is arrested and jailed.
                    </p>
                    <p>That night, Port Royal is besieged by the infamous ghost ship known as the Black Pearl — a black-sailed vessel crewed by vicious, bloodthirsty pirates, and captained by a man reputed to be "so evil that Hell itself spat him back out". The mysterious pulse that emanated from Elizabeth's medallion has "called" the Black Pearl. The pirates ransack Port Royal and kidnap Elizabeth (who hides her true identity by claiming her last name is Turner) who is in possession of the medallion. She invokes the right of parlé in order to be taken back to the ship to Captain Hector Barbossa,Sparrow's former First Mate of the Black Pearl. Elizabeth asks Barbossa to cease his attack on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. Barbossa agrees but, employing a loophole in their agreements, abducts Elizabeth.
                    </p>
                    <p>The next day, Will (having seen Elizabeth taken by the Pearl's crew) fails in his passionate efforts to convince Commodore Norrington and the Royal Navy to immediately pursue the culprits (despite the Commodore's own feelings towards Elizabeth). While the Commodore puts his faith in strategy, Will seeks help from Jack Sparrow and agrees to break him out of jail in exchange for assistance in rescuing Elizabeth. After absconding with the HMS Interceptor, the Royal Navy's fastest ship, and assembling a crew in the lawless town of Tortuga (Spanish for turtle), Jack and Will set off to find Barbossa and the Black Pearl, which is heading towards Isla de Muerta (Spanish for "Island of the Dead")— a mysterious island that is said to be undiscoverable, save for "those who already know where it is."
